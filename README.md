# lapPI
A low-coast Laptop project based on Raspberry Pi Zero W

## Material List

First of all, we´ll need:

* A Raspberry Pi Zero W (https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/).
* An old Motorola Lapdock (a peripheral that turns a Motorola Atrix smartphone into a very limited laptop, running a Linuz fork. Here is a more accurated article about: https://www.slashgear.com/motorola-lapdock-100-review-31191859/).
* A Micro SD card with a Raspian OS image (or other OS for Raspberry Pi Zero).
* A Male Micro HDMI to Female HDMI Adapter (like this one: https://pt.dhgate.com/product/micro-hdmi-adapter-hdmi-male-type-a-to-micro/396145563.html).
* A Female Micro USB to Male USB Cable (like this one: https://www.flipkart.com/pitambara-micro-usb-female-male-cable-otg-morpho-e2-e3-fingerprint-scanner-0-1-m/p/itmffhpvftmppqdc).
